Currently, the generator only builds a pool of features up to complexity 2 (in terms of the recursive def. of complexity).

A pool using all object types can be generated by including all object types in the `TYPES` list. 

However, each object types `T` that does not occur in a given domain is equivalent to `falsum` for that domain. 

Thus, any predicate using  `T`  is equivalent to the predicate using `falsum` in place of  `T`. 

Instead of generating the entire pool and pruning all such  `T` -concepts later, we can generate a separate predicate pool for each domain which already avoids all such `T` -concepts. 

This is done by commenting out predicates from `TYPES` appropriately. 

The precomputed predicate pools for the experimental domains were generated in this way.
