### Usage
This folder contains code to generate a pool of grounding predicates (concepts and roles from description logic) represented as clingo rules, starting from the primitive O2D predicates. To run the feature generator do:
```bash
python3 feature_generation.py <filename.lp>
```
The output file  ``<filename.lp>`` is stored in the ``feature_generation``. There are precomputed predicate pools for some experimental domains (Blocksworld, Sokoban, etc.). 

### Caveats
Currently, only pools of complexity 2 are generated (but this can easily be extended to arbitrary complexity).

A pool using all object types can be generated by including all object types in the `TYPES` list. 

However, each object types `T` that does not occur in a given domain is equivalent to `falsum` for that domain. 

Thus, any predicate using  `T`  is equivalent to the predicate using `falsum` in place of  `T`. 

Instead of generating the entire pool and pruning all such  `T` -concepts later, we can generate a separate predicate pool for each domain which already avoids all such `T` -concepts. 

This is done by commenting out predicates from `TYPES` appropriately. 

The precomputed predicate pools for the experimental domains were generated in this way.
