Currently, the generator only builds a pool of features up to complexity 2 (in terms of the recursive def. of complexity).

A general pool can be generated by using all object types in the TYPES list. 

However, each object types T that does not occur in a given domain is equivalent to falsum for that domain. 

Thus, any predicate using T is equivalent to the predicate using falsum in place of T. 

Instead of generating the entire pool and pruning all such T-concepts later, we can generate a separate predicate pool for each domain which already avoids all such T-concepts. 

This is done by commenting out predicates from TYPES appropriately. 

The precomputed predicate pools for the experimental domains were generated in this way.
