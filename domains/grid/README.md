### Grid

Origin: Drew McDermott. Used in the AIPS-1998 competition.

Instances are parametrised by:

x = horizontal extension of grid (num rows)
y = vertical extension of grid (num cols)
s = number of different key and lock shapes/types
k = number of keys
l = number of locks

Generation: Randomly distribute the robot, lock and key positions over the grid. The robot must not start on a locked position.
